I am a neuroscientist, currently working as a postdoctoral research scientist at the University of Cambridge. I like to use my analytical and creative skills to transform complex data into intelligible stories and compelling visualisations. My PhD project in cognitive neuroscience gave me a broad understanding of human behaviour, firmly rooted in the biology of the brain. But it has taught me even more about statistics and data analysis. My goal now is to apply these skills to other data science projects, inside or outside of academic research.
