I use my strong analytical and problem-solving skills to transform complex data into intelligible stories and compelling visualisations. My PhD project in cognitive neuroscience has given me a broad understanding of human behaviour, firmly rooted in the biology of the brain. But it has taught me even more about statistics and data analysis. My goal now is to apply these skills to other data science projects, inside or outside of academic research.
