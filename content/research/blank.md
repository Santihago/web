In my research I study the role of interoception –the sensing and perception of information from the body– in human decision-making. I use behavioural measures, electroencephalography and other physiological indicators such as our pupils, our heart rate, or our breathing, to elucidate the interplay between brain and body in decision-making. I am currently supported by a grant from the Wiener-Anspach foundation.
