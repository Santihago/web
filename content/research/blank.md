In my research I study the role of interoception –the sensing and perception of information from the body– in human decision-making. I use behavioural measures, electroencephalography and other physiological indicators such as our pupils, our heart rate, or our breathing, to elucidate the interplay between brain and body in decision-making. I am currently supported by a grant from the Wiener-Anspach foundation.

All the projects where I am first author have {{< icon name="open-data" pack="ai">}} open data, {{< icon name="open-materials" pack="ai">}} open materials, and are published in {{< icon name="open-access" pack="ai">}} open access.
